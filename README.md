### A Dart 2D physics engine

*This is a Dart port of Java's Box2D libraries.*

*The Java Box2D library was originally written by Daniel Murphy (status
February 2015).*

```
benchmark/bench2d.dart   Benchmark used by Joel Webber
example/index.html       Browser demos as written by Dominic Hamon
lib/                     Port of Daniel Murphy's jbox2d
```

First Dart port of an earlier version of Box2D library was
done by Dominic Hamon. We are grateful for his work.

Major refactor of the coding style was done in 2020 by spydon (Lukas Klingsbo).
